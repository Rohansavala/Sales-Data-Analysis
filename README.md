Step 3: Data Type Detection
Action: Promoted headers and employed 'Detect Data Type' to automatically categorize each column.
Step 4: Datetime Splitting
Action: Split datetime into date and timestamp, enhancing data granularity for precise insights.
# Visualization of Data:
Step 5: Sales Trends Analysis
Action: Implemented a line chart to explore sales trends over time, providing strategic insights.
Step 6: Best-Selling Products
Action: Utilized a tree map for visually identifying and analyzing the best-selling products.
Step 7: Top 5 Products Display
